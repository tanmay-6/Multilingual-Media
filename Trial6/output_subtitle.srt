1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
What's your take on Pakistan?

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,600
The economy is on the brink of collapse.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,040
The source of money is drying up.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
The world is very late in realising

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
how much of a threat it poses.

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,320
And there is no such thing as a good terrorist and a bad terrorist.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
Kind of money the Americans have pumped into Pakistan is insane.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,760
It's like the perfect storm that Pakistan is going through.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,440
And we don't want the state to collapse

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,960
because we can't change the geography.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,320
We can't change who enables.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,320
You're basically saying it's unpredictable what will happen.

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,560
But it's likely that it will be a volatile situation.

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,760
It may break up for all we know.

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,800
The country may break up.

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
This just too much tension.
