00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,537
What's your take on Pakistan? The economy is on the brink of collapse.

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:07,193
The source of money is drying up. The world is very late in realizing how

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:10,609
much of a threat it poses. And there is no such thing as a good

4
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,641
terrorist and a bad terrorist. The kind of money the Americans have pumped into Pakistan

5
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:17,833
is insane. It's like the perfect storm that Pakistan is going through.

6
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:20,985
And we don't want the state to collapse because we can't change the geography,

7
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:24,345
we can't change who our neighbour is. You're basically saying it's unpredictable what will happen,

8
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:27,177
but it's likely that it will be a volatile situation. It may break up,

9
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:30,105
for all we know, the country may break up. There's just too much tension.
