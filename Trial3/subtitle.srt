1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,331
I think you already know that if you want
to improve your English speaking skills, you

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:07,259
have to practice, right?

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,030
You have to speak.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,289
Studying grammar will never improve your speaking.

5
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:15,950
Listening to English alone will never improve
your speaking.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,530
You have to actually speak.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,700
But what if you don't have someone to talk
to in English?

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,810
How can you practice then?

9
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,560
Well, there's a technique that allows you
to learn to speak English by yourself.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,320
No speaking partner is required.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,359
This technique can help improve many aspects
of your spoken English: your sentence structure,

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:45,140
your grammar, your vocabulary, and most importantly,
your ability to express your thoughts and

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,350
ideas effectively.

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,820
So what is this technique?

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,780
Well, here's what it is...

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,489
Learning to speak English through imitation.

17
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:01,170
When I say imitation, I'm not talking about
repeating after native speakers using the

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,019
exact same words to improve your pronunciation.

19
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,030
I'm talking about something a little more
advanced than that.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,470
Here's how it works: you listen to a conversation,
a story, or some kind of speech, and then

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,400
try to deliver that speech in your own words.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,550
Let's see this technique in action:

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,960
When I was a child

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,630
When he was a child

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,640
my parents liked to pretend, like many other
parents

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,600
his parents liked to pretend, like many other
parents

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,210
that Santa Claus would bring us presents at
Christmas.

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,370
His parents liked to pretend that Santa Claus
would bring them presents at Christmas.

29
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,420
So when my siblings and I would wake up on
Christmas morning

30
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,970
So when he and his siblings would wake up
on Christmas morning

31
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,520
there'd be a bunch of presents, from supposedly
Santa Claus, sitting in front of the fireplace.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,180
there'd be a bunch of presents, from supposedly
Santa Claus, sitting in front of the fireplace.

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,910
So that's how it works.

34
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,060
But that's just one way to do it.

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,370
There're other ways too.

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:10,490
For example, instead of imitating small portions
of speech like phrases and short sentences,

37
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,540
you can imitate larger portions of speech.

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,560
So in this case, you wait until the speaker
completes a thought or an idea, then pause

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,870
and try to express that idea yourself.

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,890
Another approach is to simply listen to the
whole speech and then try to deliver that

41
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,100
entire speech yourself.

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,990
So there are several ways to go about it,
but what I recommend is to combine them all

43
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,610
together, and I call this approach easy-to-hard
imitation.

44
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,700
Easy-to-hard imitation is based on the concept
of progressive training.

45
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,650
The idea is that you start with something
easy and then increase the difficulty of the

46
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,010
activity, forcing yourself to get better.

47
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,709
A number of studies have found this kind of
training to be very effective.

48
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,240
Here's how you can apply this concept: start
by imitating small portions of speech first

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,319
like phrases and short sentences, then move
on to imitating larger portions of speech

50
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:16,470
like long sentences or even groups of sentences,
and finally, try to deliver the entire speech

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,480
on your own.

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,250
This technique offers many benefits.

53
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,520
You get to listen and imitate correct English,
which helps you learn to form sentences properly.

54
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,560
You get to learn idioms, expressions, and
other speaking patterns that are used in day-to-day

55
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,239
conversations.

56
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,000
you get to learn grammar.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,080
When you imitate other people, you're learning
grammar through a process called implicit

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
learning.

59
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,610
This is the process where the learning happens
without your awareness.

60
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,820
This is how babies and children learn the
grammar rules of their first language.

61
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,010
When you imitate, you don't think about grammar.

62
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,590
You're not trying to understand why the present
perfect tense is used in this situation or

63
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,319
in that situation.

64
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:10,730
Instead, you're focused on communication â€” on
understanding and expressing ideas.

65
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,360
You're still learning grammar but you're not
aware that it's happening.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,640
This is one of the proper ways to learn grammar.

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,160
OK, that concludes this video.

68
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,440
To help you get started, I've put together
a step-by-step tutorial on this technique.
